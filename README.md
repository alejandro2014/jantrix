# README #

This is my own own implementation of the tetris game. The project is to convert this application into an android application. Originally this was my first game (developed in 2009)

### How do I get set up? ###

* You need maven to execute this project. The scripts "build" and "run" contain the maven tasks so those are transparent to the developer

### TODO list ###

* Fix the bugs in the game
* Refactor the code to a more understandable format
* Create the score table
* Choose the level that the user wants to start from
* Transform the java game into an android application
